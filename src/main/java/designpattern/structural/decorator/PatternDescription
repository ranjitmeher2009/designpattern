The decorator design pattern allows us to dynamically add functionality and behavior
to an object without affecting the behavior of other existing objects in the same class.

We use inheritance to extend the behavior of the class. This takes place at compile time,
and all of the instances of that class get the extended behavior.

Decorator design patterns allow us to add functionality to an object (not the class) at runtime,
and we can apply this customized functionality to an individual object based on our requirement and choice.

Decorator patterns allow a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure.
So, there is no change to the original class.

The decorator design pattern is a structural pattern, which provides a wrapper to the existing class.

Decorator design pattern uses abstract classes or interfaces with the composition to implement the wrapper.

Decorator design patterns create decorator classes, which wrap the original class and provide additional functionality
by keeping the class methods' signature unchanged.

Decorator design patterns are most often used for applying single responsibility principles
since we divide the functionality into classes with unique areas of concern.

The decorator design pattern is structurally similar to the chain of responsibility pattern.
